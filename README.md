### **NOTE:** The problem statement for this project is defined below. All of the parts are accessible from one Jupyter notebook in this repository which is **`IBM_Capstone_Project.ipynb`**.

Parts 1, 2, and 3 utilize Python and involve data collection, wrangling, and exploratory analysis.
Part 4 utilizes SQL in Python and involves visualization.
Part 5 is the dashboard **(designed for non-mobile and cellular devices)** created with Tableau, accessible from the URL in the Jupyter notebook.
Part 6 is the presentation, accessible from **`IBM_Capstone_Presentation.pdf`**.

**For Part 6: GitHub does not provide previews of PDF files therefore they must be downloaded and viewed on your local device.**

Extensive information on the dataset used is accessible from **`IBM_Dataset_Information.pdf`**.

The original dashboard for the certification was required to be made with IBM Cognos Analytics, however I've redesigned a custom version of the dashboard in Tableau in order to further my skill set. Static PDF copies of all versions of the dashboard (Cognos / Tableau-[workstation/phone]) can be found in the resources archive file below:

All project resources including dashboard graphics and all datasets linked in the Jupyter notebook are accessible from `IBM_Dataset_archive.zip` where once unzipped, Part 1 uses `jobs.json`, Part 2 uses `m1_survey_data.csv`, Part 3 uses `m2_survey_data.csv`, Part 4 uses `m4_survey_data.sqlite`, and Part 5 uses `m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv` & `m5_survey_data_demographics.csv`.

Further notes and comments on this project are included in the Jupyter notebook.

# **Problem Statement: Analysis of Developer Trends from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey**

**Background:** The rapidly evolving technology landscape has resulted in a dynamic developer environment, where understanding trends in programming languages, databases, and developer satisfaction is essential for organizations aiming to attract and retain talent. The 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, encompassing insights from approximately 9,000 software professionals globally, provides a unique dataset for analysis. By exploring this data, companies can gain valuable insights into the current and future needs of developers, facilitating strategic decisions in hiring, training, and employee engagement.

**Objectives:**

1. **Identify Trends**: Analyze survey responses to identify key trends in programming languages and database technologies among developers.
1. **Developer Satisfaction**: Examine satisfaction levels regarding job and career among developers to understand how professional development opportunities affect retention and performance.
1. **Open Source Engagement**: Investigate the relationship between community engagement through open-source contributions and overall job satisfaction.
1. **Segmentation**: Segment respondents based on demographics, employment status, coding practices, and aspirations to discover distinct groups within the developer community.
1. **Actionable Insights**: Provide actionable recommendations for organizations to enhance their hiring practices, training initiatives, and strategies to foster a supportive work environment for developers.

**Expected Outcome:** By the end of this analysis, organizations will:

* Gain insights into current programming and database trends that can inform future hiring and training strategies.
* Understand how job and career satisfaction correlate with professional development opportunities, allowing for tailored employee engagement initiatives.
* Recognize the importance of community involvement and open-source contributions in enhancing developer job satisfaction.
* Develop a comprehensive understanding of the diverse needs within the developer community, leading to improved talent acquisition strategies and retention rate growth of 20%.

**Data Sources:**

* Developer demographic information (age, gender, location, education level).
* Developer employment data (job satisfaction, career satisfaction, employment status).
* Data on programming languages, frameworks, and database environments commonly used and desired by developers.
* Feedback on work structure, remote working preferences, and coding practices.
